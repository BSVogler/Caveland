![Wurfelengine logo](http://wurfelengine.net/images/logo_medium.png)

Wurfelengine is a 2.5D isometric Java block world game engine build with the support of libGDX.
The name comes from the german word for cube (WÃ¼rfel).

Version 1.1. introduce many new features and bugfixes.

If you want to use the engine take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/Cbeed/Wurfel-Engine/wiki).


### The Goal

1. Provide a "normal" open source game engine because open source games are always geek games (e.g with ASCII output).
2. An easy engine for strategy or adventure games.
3. Minecraft is hip, so are blocks.

### Features

* Free: No licensing costs
* Open Source:
	* Well documented
	* Clean code: no geeky code with strange indent and names
* Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android (in work))
* Map Streaming: make maps as big as you want like in Minecraft or Skyrim
* Three Dimensions: make maps with high buildings or deep dungeons
* Map editor: free & included
* Fast: Wurfelengine renders only what is visible 
* Easy: look at our examples (at wurfelengine.net) how easy it is to build a small game
* Small: The engine is currently under 5 MB file size (+5 MB libGDX)
