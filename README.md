![Wurfelengine logo](http://wurfelengine.net/images/logo_medium.png)

Wurfelengine is a 2.5D isometric Java block world game engine build with the support of libGDX.
The name comes from the german word for "cube(s)" ("WÃ¼rfel") of which the terrain consists.

If you want to use the engine for your game, prototype etc. take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/Cbeed/Wurfel-Engine/wiki).

### Features
* **Free**: No licensing costs
* **Open Source**:
	* Well documented
	* Clean code: Precise names, logical indent, commented
* **Cross-platform** (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android (in work))
* **Map Streaming**: make maps as big as you want like in Minecraft or Skyrim
* **Three Dimensions**: make maps with high buildings or deep dungeons
* **Map editor**: Shape you world on the fly with the build in WYSIWYG map editor.
You can swich directly between editor and game.
* **Fast**: Wurfel Engine uses Sprites for rendering.
* **efficient**: It renders only what is visible 
* **Small**: The engine is currently under 4 MB file size (+5 MB libGDX)

### The Goal
1. Provide a solid open source game engine because open source games are always geek games (e.g. with ASCII output).
2. An easy and fast engine for strategy or adventure games.
3. Minecraft is hip, so are blocks.
