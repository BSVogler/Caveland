Wurfel Engine
============

The Wurfel Engine is a 2.5D isometric Java game engine build with Slick (soon: libgdx).
The name comes from the german word for cube (WÃ¼rfel).

### The Goal

1. Provide a normal open source game engine because open source games are always geek games (often in ASCII)
2. An easy engine for strategy or adventure games
3. Minecraft is hip, so are blocks.

### Features

* Open Source:
	* Well commented
	* Clean code: no geeky code with strange indent and names
	* No licensing costs
* Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
* Map Streaming: make maps as big as you want like in Minecraft
* Three Dimensions: make maps with high buildings or deep dungeons
* Map editor: free & included
* Fast: Wurfelengine renders only what is visible 
* Easy: look at our examples (soon) how easy it is to build a small game
