### The Goal

1. Provide a "normal" open source game engine because open source games are always geek games (often in ASCII)
2. An easy engine for strategy or adventure games
3. Minecraft is hip, so are blocks.

### Features

* Free: No licensing costs
* Open Source:
	* Well documented
	* Clean code: no geeky code with strange indent and names
* Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android (in work))
* Map Streaming: make maps as big as you want like in Minecraft or Skyrim
* Three Dimensions: make maps with high buildings or deep dungeons
* Map editor: free & included
* Fast: Wurfelengine renders only what is visible 
* Easy: look at our examples (at wurfelengine.net) how easy it is to build a small game
* Small: The engine is currently under 5 MB file size
